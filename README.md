That's a nice Arch! FFFFFZZZZZZZ!!!!!

Part of [Build For STL](http://buildforstl.org/) for 2015, May 29 through May 31 (a week earlier that the rest of NDOCH 2015).

Here we have a Minecraft world of the City of St. Louis, Missouri and St. Louis County, Missouri.

[Click here](http://opendatastl.github.io/minecraft-stlouis/output/) to see a rendered version of the map.

* [St. Louis County GIS OpenData Website](http://openstlco.stlcogis.opendata.arcgis.com/) powered by ArcGIS

Using FME, we took local GIS information and processed it into a Minecraft Map. ([This article](https://knowledge.safe.com/articles/Samples_and_Demos/How-to-make-Minecraft-worlds) explains how it is done.)

Made in St. Louis!

## Features
* Custom Mobs!

## TODO (Now with more random thoughts)
* See if there is a way to take data from [OpenStreetMaps](Openstreetmap.org) and add that as a layer. (See if MaptimeSTL wants to get in on this!)
* See if there is a way to align sections of this map with the grid used in [Wunnenberg's Street Guies](http://www.wunnenbergs.com/?page_id=97) for St. Louis City & County.
* Need to add water blocks to our map. Especially the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers!
* Find resources for GIS in the following counties:
  * St. Charles, MO (I have some BIG, BIG ideas for this! I'm thinking the Conflunece map idea could also be possible.)
  * Jefferson, MO (Mine for LEAD!)
  * St. Louis Exurbs Missouri Counties: Franklin, Lincoln, Warren
  * Farmington microSA Missouri Counties: St. Francois, Madison
  * Metro East Illinois Counties: Madison, St. Clair, Monroe (Mine for Coal! Forge steel in Granite City!)
  * Riverbend Illinois Counties: Greene and Calhoun (Corresponds with that notch in the Mississippi River that turns a trip from Florissant to Grafton from a 10 mile drive to a 30 mile drive!)
  * Metro East Exurb Illinois Counties: Jersey, MacCoupin, Clinton, Bond
  * Kaskaskia: Ste. Genevieve, MO and Randolph, IL
    * I'd really like to see this area. 
 * Cities to eventually consider Mincrafting:
   * Kansas City (Jackson, Clay, Platte, Cass counties in Missouri; Wydandotte, Leavenworth, Johnson, Miami counties in Kansas) (If you are doing such a project, let us know!)
   * Lawrence and Topeka, Kansas (Douglas and Shawnee Counties, just outside of the periphery of the KC KS-MO area.)
   * Kansas City Exurb Counties: Lafayette, Ray, Clinton, Bates, Caldwell, Johnson Counties in Missouri; Franklin and Linn Counties in Kansas.)
   * St. Joseph, MO (Buchanan County, Missouri, and maybe Andrew County in Missouri if you want to get all of I-229)
   * Sedalia, MO (Pettis County, MO) (Build your own Missouri State Fair!)
   * Jefferson City and Columbia, MO (Boone and Cole Counties, MO)
   * Springfield, MO (Greene County, MO)
   * Joplin, MO (Jasper and Newton Counties, MO)
   * Springfield, IL (Sangamon County, MO)
   * Hannibal, MO (See if there some way to recreate the Adventures of Tom Sawyer.)
   * Branson, MO...or [BRONSON, MO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bt4Ly9_9Qg) (Tandy County, MO)
 * Special areas to consider Minecrafting:
   * A Confluence Map: A special version of Rivers around North St. Louis County, the St. Charles County panhandle, Southern Calhoun County in Illinois, the Southern Jersey County in Illinois, and Western Madison County in Illinois.

That last point has my interest.  In that stretch of land area, the Illinois River flows into the Mississippi River.  The Missouri River flows into the Mississippi River.  There are high cliffs, high bluffs, and low river lands and low flood plains.

The combination of the two is what makes Calhoun County so isolated it is nicknamed "The Island County", when it is really more of an inland peninsula.

The city of Alton is built on rocky and hilly terrain. On a couple of streets there is a 50 degree slope.

On the other side of that part of the Mississippi are floodplains in St. Charles County where the towns of Portage Des Souix and [West Alton](http://westaltonmo.com/) are a rural reprieve from the suburban area of North St. Louis County.  Wetlands and wildlife surround these area.  This geography appears at the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, and also spans into the Columbia Bottoms area on the southern bank of the Missouri River in Northeastern St. Louis County and the east bank of the confluence in Madison County where much of the area is low-lying plains and farmland which are a stark contrast from the City on the other side. (I might be able to have some fun with that in the St. Louis Map if it made it in there.)

The eastern part of St. Charles County would be about as isolated as Calhoun County if it hadn't been for the construction of the Lewis and Clark Bridges that link Alton with North St. Louis County.  In the early days before any of the bridges in that area were built, a ferry crossing at the end of New Halls Ferry Road would transport people between St. Louis County and St. Charles County.  Hence the name of highways like New Halls Ferry. The history of which you can read about on the [Old Jamestown Association](http://www.oldjamestownassn.org/old_jamestown_history) and [Spanish Lake Community Association](http://spanishlakemo.org/Timeline%20of%20Spanish%20Lake%20History) websites.

Pelican Island (which despite its name doesn't have any last I checked) is divided by the Car of Commerce Chute, a shallow naturally carved canal that when the river is low, you can walk to it on a rock path between Sioux Passage County Park in North County.  It is the largest island in that area where many smaller island are used by some folks to put small summer houses on near Grafton.

Features worth Minecrafting would also include the [Our Lady of The River Shrine](http://ourladyoftheriversshrine.org/), a statue that lies on the South shore of the Mississippi River near Portage Des Souix, the Lewis and Clark observation tower in Hartford, IL, and the Piasa Bird when appears in the cliffs along Jersey County near Madison County on Illinois Highway 100.

Wildlife is plentiful in the wetland areas, although, I do wish Minecraft had mobs for Bald Eagles, Hawks, Cranes, Box Turtles (please brake for turtles on US 67!), fish and of course snakes!

For the most part, the notorious Asian Carp (the jumping fish that doesn't just slap but PUNCHES people on boats) is not a problem in the rivers in this area, espeically in the Illinois River where their activity seems to be confined to probably Greene County on northward.  Personally, I've never seen them, and I hope I never do!
