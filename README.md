That's a nice Arch! FFFFFZZZZZZZ!!!!!

Part of [Build For STL](http://buildforstl.org/) for 2015, May 29 through May 31 (a week earlier that the rest of NDOCH 2015).

Here we have a Minecraft world of the City of St. Louis, Missouri and St. Louis County, Missouri.

## Resources
* [St. Louis County GIS Github](https://github.com/stlouisco/stlouisco-gis)
* [St. Louis County GIS OpenData Website](http://openstlco.stlcogis.opendata.arcgis.com/) powered by ArcGIS
* [FME](http://www.safe.com/fme/fme-desktop/trial-download/) by SAFE. **TRIALWARE!**
* [NOva Skin](http://novaskin.me/) for providing the [Gallery](http://minecraft.novaskin.me/gallery) and skins to mod.

Using FME, we took local GIS information and processed it into a Minecraft Map. ([This article](https://knowledge.safe.com/articles/Samples_and_Demos/How-to-make-Minecraft-worlds) explains how it is done.)

Made in St. Louis!
